#üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bike Rental Demand Forecasting
Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting bike rental demand using various machine learning techniques. The model leverages historical bike rental data in Seoul from 2017 to 2018 along with weather and temporal features to predict the number of bike rentals in a given period. The primary focus is on comparing the performance of different modeling approaches, particularly XGBoost and linear regression.

### Project Description
The Bike Rental Demand Forecasting project uses a dataset that captures bike rental counts along with various influencing factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal trends. The project employs different machine learning algorithms to build models that predict bike rental demand, enabling better resource allocation and operational efficiency for bike-sharing systems.

### Key Objectives
Select Features: Identify the most relevant features for predicting bike rentals.
Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train Models: Implement various machine learning algorithms to predict bike rentals.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
Make Predictions: Use the best-performing model to make future predictions.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following:

Access Google Collab
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, scipy
You can install the necessary libraries using the pip feature.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling Missing and Duplicate Values: Identify and manage any missing or duplicate data points in the dataset.
- Data Type Conversion**: Converting data types to appropriate formats for analysis.
- Data Splitting: Splitting data where needed to enhance further handling of the data, namely the Date variable into Day / Months /Years.
- Data Profiling: Getting a comprehensive report on the data.
- Outlier Detection: Identify outliers that may skew the analysis.

## Data Exploration
To identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, which are crucial for building an effective predictive model. Steps included:

- Distribution Analysis: Visualize variable distributions effectively.
- Demand by Category: Assess impact of categories on demand.
- Hourly Variation: Explore demand across different hours.
- Demand Trends: Examine patterns over time.
- Demand Comparison: Analyze variations between weekdays and weekends.
- Seasonal Representation: Check data adequacy for bias avoidance.
- Weather Influence: Analyze demand correlation with weather variables.
- Multi-Variable Analysis: Investigate interactions between influencing factors.
- Preprocessing Needs: Determine scaling or transformation requirements.

## Modeling

Feature Selection
Features were selected based on their correlation with the target variable (bike rental counts). Key features include:

Weather variables (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Temporal variables (hour, day of the week, month, season)
Special events (holidays)

Model Training
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented:
- Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor

Each model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated on a validation dataset.

## Model Evaluation
Model performance was assessed using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ Score. Results are visualized to compare the effectiveness of each model.

## Results
The XGBoost model outperformed linear regression, yielding a lower Mean Squared Error and higher R¬≤ Score, indicating its superiority in capturing complex relationships in the data.
